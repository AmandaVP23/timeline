# To do list
- [x] #1
- [ ] Have functions in props like renderGroupItem that receives parameters like groupId, that allows override render;
- [ ] Receive props like intervalType (day, week, month) that is used to decide what to show;
- [ ] Decide what date library to use or if we need to use one;
- [ ] Receive color code when rendering the "event" box but also make available a function to override the render, so it can be customized, example: holiday event;

# Reminders:
- Try to keep everything easy to customize;
- This is going to be used initially for Void HR, but we need to keep this library independent, so it can be used later if needed;
